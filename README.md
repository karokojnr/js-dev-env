<b>Editor and Configuration</b>
First of all, editor of choice here is surprise surprise VS Code. Iâ€™m actually happly surprised that Erich Gamma is behind this.

Use EditorConfig to manage, well, editor configurations. Tabs VS spaces, etc. Note that VS Code need to install a plugin for it to work.

The example {{temp|kbd|.editorconfig}}file:
{{CodeBox|
<source lang="javascript">
root = true

[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
charset = utf-8

[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
}}
